# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates


### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
To be honest, I was not officially reviewed by other students because my pull requests were not selected. I didn’t get the 
chance to receive feedback from others, but I still learned from reading the reviews given to other students. It helped me 
understand what good feedback looks like and what common mistakes to avoid.


### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
Unfortunately, I was unable to review other people's code through GitHub because the people who were supposed to tag me 
did not tag me and I did not receive a request from GitHub to review the code. However, I did review my classmates' code 
during class discussions and during pair work. This allowed me to learn how different people solve the same problem in 
unique ways, and it gave me ideas for improving my own code.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
Even though I didn’t always formally write down my estimates, I learned that estimating time helps me plan better and avoid 
last-minute stress. When I started thinking about how long a task might take, I became more aware of my own pace and where 
I usually get stuck. I also realized that it's important to include time for testing and fixing bugs — not just the actual coding.
Estimating is not always accurate, but it helps me develop time management skills and stay more organized.


## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I was not officially reviewed by other students, since my pull requests weren’t selected. However, I read some of the reviews 
given to others on GitHub and in class. This helped me understand how constructive feedback works and what kind of mistakes
to look out for in my own code — such as naming, logic structure, or readability.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I didn’t get the opportunity to formally review other students’ pull requests on GitHub. But I did look at my classmates’ 
code during prac sessions and group discussions. This helped me see different ways to approach problems, and sometimes their 
solutions were simpler or cleaner than mine. It made me reflect on how I write code and where I can improve

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Not available - I didn't officially submit GitHub reviews.]()

### Explanation
I didn’t get the chance to do an official review via pull request, but I did give verbal suggestions during class to peers 
when we compared code. I gave feedback about structure and naming, and asked helpful questions like “What happens if the input is invalid?”
which helped both of us think deeper about the logic.

### Good Code Review 2

[Not available - I didn't officially submit GitHub reviews.]()

### Explanation

Again, I didn’t submit a GitHub-based review, but I’ve had useful discussions with other students where we gave each other 
feedback. I learned to express ideas in a supportive and helpful way, focusing on the code rather than the person. This helped build confidence and mutual improvement.



## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add short summary videos or diagrams at the start of each prac to help students quickly understand the concepts.
Sometimes the written instructions are long or unclear, especially when you're new to a topic. A visual guide or example would make it easier to start confidently.
Also, more support for setup issues (like virtual environments) would be helpful.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I kept improving each week. I made sure to complete most of the practicals, committed regularly to GitHub with clear messages, and paid attention to writing clean and understandable code. 
I also started using better naming conventions and broke problems into smaller steps, which helped me debug more efficiently.
